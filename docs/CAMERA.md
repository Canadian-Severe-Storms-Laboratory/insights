# Creating and Uploading Event Path Panorama Captures Using the ```iSTAR Pulsar Camera``` and ```NTP 360```

## Operating the ```iSTAR Pulsar Camera```

> ```01``` Setting up the Camera Hardware

To turn on the ```iSTAR Pulsar Camera```, first connect it to an available power source. Then, ensuring that the mode selector switch is set to ```Right```, press and release the power button. Wait for 2-3 minutes until the bottom light (system status) and the top light (wifi status) both turn from red to solid green.

> ```02``` Setting up the Camera Software

To connect to the ```iSTAR Pulsar Camera```â€™s local network, navigate to ```Settings > Network & internet > Internet```. Select the ```pulsar-*****``` network, and enter ```pulsar-1234``` as the password.

The camera is controlled using the ```iSTAR Pulsar``` app, available on ```Android``` devices. Making sure you are connected to the ```pulsar-*****``` network, navigate to ```Network Connection``` in the ```iSTAR Pulsar``` app.  Press ```Select a network > Refresh Network List``` and select the hotspot name (e.g., for NTP's Pixel 7a, the hotspot name is ```NTP Pixel```). Enter the hotspot password and press ```Join network``` (do not enable ```Upload on this network```).

Once the hotspot is select, turn on the device hotspot by navigating to ```Settings > Network & internet > Hotspot & tethering > Wi-Fi hotspot``` and enabling ```Use Wi-Fi hotspot```. Finally, return to the ```iSTAR Pulsar app``` and begin capturing once the camera sets the GPS lock.

## Using ```NCTech Immersive Studio``` for Data Formation

> ```01``` Raw Camera Files

To export capture sequences from the camera hardware to an external SSD, connect the SSD directly to the camera. In the ```iSTAR Pulsar``` app, click ```Copy to USB-C``` on the desired capture sequence and wait for the transfer to complete. (**Note**: there is a bug in the app that creates empty file transfers after the first transfer. To avoid this, re-launch the app for each transfer.)

For each capture sequence, the ```iSTAR Pulsar Camera``` generates a folder containing a ```.onctd``` file, a ```.onctv``` file, and an ```info.txt``` file. To process these files into panorama images, launch ```NCTech Immersive Studio``` and navigate to ```Data Formation```. For ```Input```, select the folder containing these files, and for ```Output```, select a desired folder to export the panoramas to.

> ```02``` Configuring the Necessary Data Formation Settings

Under the ```Options``` dropdown, change the number of frames to process from ```-1``` to the desired number. Under the ```Advanced``` dropdown, select ```Add Mirror Ball``` so that the exported images will have a mirror ball effect over the otherwise black region. Once these and other desired settings are configured, click ```Process``` and wait for ```Status``` to be ```Done```.

## Retrieving Comparison Panoramas from ```Street View Download 360```

> ```01``` Overview

```NTP 360``` allows users to upload older street-level imagery from ```Google Street View``` to create before/after comparisons on damage sites. After uploading a set of panoramas, ```NTP 360``` creates a copyable or downloadable list of panorama IDs based on the closest locations to the ```iSTAR Pulsar``` panorama uploads. ```Street View Download 360``` is a desktop application that can process these panorama IDs in bulk and export a folder of comparison panoramas.

> ```02``` Configuring the Street View Download 360 Settings

Before your first export, it is important to ensure that your file name settings are configured correctly, as ```NTP 360``` uses the panorama ID in the file name to appropriately match up before/after panoramas.

Navigate to ```Settings > Saving panoramas > Custom filename```. In the ```Filename``` text input field, enter ```%p%```. This will name each image file after its panorama ID.

Back in ```Panorama Download```, set the desired file path to export to, select ```Multiple Panoramas```, paste the list of panorama IDs, and set the desired image resolution. Once ready, click ```Download Panorama```.
